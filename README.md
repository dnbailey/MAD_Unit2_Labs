# Mobile App Development

## Unit 2 Labs

The majority of the labs for this unit build on previous work, so they will all be based in the same project. You'll sumbit your code for review using Git and GitHub.

## Submitting Work

Since we are working exclusively in Xcode, you'll use the Source Control menu to commit and push your code to GitHub. You should submit each lab as a separate commit.
